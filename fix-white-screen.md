# Fix White Screen Issue

The white screen is likely caused by missing type definitions for the AI agent tables. Here's how to fix it:

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the AI agent tables migration
supabase db push
```

### 2. Update Supabase Types
```bash
# Generate new types with AI agent tables
supabase gen types typescript --project-id rslwcgjgzezptoblckua > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### 4. Clear Browser Cache
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

## ðŸš¨ If Still Having Issues

### Option A: Temporarily Disable New Features
The new components are already commented out in the code. The app should work without them.

### Option B: Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Share the errors if you see any

### Option C: Test Without PWA Features
The PWA features are already disabled. The app should work normally.

## âœ… What Should Work Now

After applying the migration and updating types:

- âœ… User authentication
- âœ… Dashboard loading
- âœ… Expense management
- âœ… Budget tracking
- âœ… Voice input (existing functionality)
- âœ… All existing features

## ðŸ”„ Re-enable Features Later

Once the app is working, you can gradually re-enable the new features:

1. **Re-enable PWA**: Uncomment `usePWA()` in App.tsx
2. **Re-enable Accessibility**: Uncomment AccessibilityProvider
3. **Re-enable PWA Components**: Uncomment PWAInstallPrompt in Dashboard

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Make sure the database migration was applied successfully
3. Verify the types file was updated correctly
4. Try a different browser to rule out cache issues

The app should now work without the white screen issue!
